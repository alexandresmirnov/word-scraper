# Word Scraper

## What is this?

This is (will be) part of a larger project with the aim of automating adding Chinese word cards to my Anki deck. It is inspired by [yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/) but with slightly more extensibility.

This module will provide the CLI for word scraping as well as a RESTful server.


## Setup

- `go get github.com/cortesi/modd/cmd/modd`

## Running

- `modd`
- `go build .; ./word-scraper -forvo`
